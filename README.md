# Banana for Scale

Measure things using a Banana for scale.  
Banana for Scale is a hackathon project built for HackED 2021.  
This app is entirely client sided and utilizes Vue with TypeScript for framework.  
[Tensorflow.js's CocoSSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) model is used for object detection.  
The size of the detected banana is used to measure the dimensions of the desired object.
