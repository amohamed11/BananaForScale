Slide 1
hello everyone & good afternoon, I'm Anas and this Banana for Scale, 
In short, Banana for Scale allows you to measure objects by using a Banana for scale.

Inspiration & Motivation
pretty simple as far as things go
a. eliminate all ruler from this world, cause I always used to forgot to pack them.
b. and internet memes.
really, just vital issues.

Solution
for this project, I utilized Tensorflow.js' object detection which runs client-side
1. to detect the banana & the object to be measured.
2. then computed the difference between the mean size of a Banana & the image.
3. then finally used this difference to approximate the dimensions of the desired object.

Demo
alright demo time.
1. Banana & phone
   Height is ~10cm which is about the size of Nokia brick phones
   so that is relatively accurate. alright one more.
2. Banana & dog 
   from my short search, that seems to be in the ball park of the size of a small puppy.
   but that says cat (huh), which segues prefectly into the next slide

Problems
- Bananas have weird shapes thanks to their arc, which combined with the angle can drastically 
  affect the accurary of the measurement.
- There is a more accurate measurement called Five Points measurement which accounts for this arc,
  which involves a whole lot of calculation, and I failed Calculus 2 (pause), 
  so first-order approximation will have to do for now.
- Tensorflowjs is just horrible inaccurate, which is due to its limitation to run in browser, but (go next)


Future Improvements

References
here are two papers that I were useful for this project:
1. First, is where I got the mean dimensions for bananas.
2. Second is where the aformentioned Five Points measurement is from.

End 
well that's it, 
thank you everyone for your time, hope you learned something useful from this.
any questions?
